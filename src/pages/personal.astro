        <p>
          I believe enduring companies are built by people who obsess over clarity, elevate craft,
          and carry a deep respect for the customer. The work is not just to ship software, but to
          shape systems that compound—products that simplify life, teams that grow each other, and
          decisions that stand the test of time.

        <h2>Education and career</h2>
        <p>
          I studied in India and the U.S., with roots in Roorkee and graduate research at the
          University at Buffalo. Over the years, I’ve led teams and initiatives at companies
          including Intuit, Atlassian, AOL, E2open, and Paylocity—bringing a leadership style
          centered on clarity, creativity, and execution.

        <h2>Community and service</h2>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about expanding opportunity—especially for women and under‑represented
          talent in tech. I invest time in mentoring, education, and programs that open doors and
          help people build lasting careers.

        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>
          Born in North India, I moved to the U.S. for school and now live in Northern California
          with my wife and two daughters. My proudest work is instilling in my daughters the values
          and love of learning my parents fostered in me.
