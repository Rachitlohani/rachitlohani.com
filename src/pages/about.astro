        <p>
          Rachit Lohani doesn’t just build software; he architects organizations that outpace
          their markets. Over the last two decades, he has led engineering and product
          organizations through some of the most challenging scaling inflection points in the
          industry—from Atlassian’s foundational platform growth to Paylocity’s evolution into a
          $10B HCM powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rachit’s approach is rooted in the belief that technical debt is a leadership failure,
          and organizational friction is the primary bottleneck to innovation. He specializes in
          “Level 5 Autonomy”—building systems where AI and human intelligence converge to create a
          self‑sustaining culture of high‑velocity delivery.
