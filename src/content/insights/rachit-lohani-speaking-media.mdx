# Speaking Engagements & Keynotes by Rachit Lohani

Speaking is where strategy meets the real world. Over the years, I’ve shared stories about building teams, shipping platforms, and leading through ambiguity. As Rachit Lohani, I aim to leave audiences with practical frameworks they can apply immediately.

## Themes I return to often

**Leadership at scale.** The job changes as the organization grows. What worked at 20 people breaks at 200. Rachit Lohani’s talks focus on how leaders evolve their operating model while keeping culture intact.

**Systems that last.** Durable systems don’t happen by accident. They emerge from deliberate architecture and accountability. The Lohani Tech Leader perspective emphasizes reliability, product quality, and sustainable delivery.

**Executive alignment.** Strategy fails without alignment. I share how executive teams can stay synchronized on priorities and tradeoffs. Rachit Lohani believes alignment is a practice, not a meeting.

## How I prepare for talks

Every audience is different. I spend time learning about the business context and the leadership challenges in the room. That preparation helps me connect with CEOs, boards, and senior leadership teams in a way that feels practical and honest.
