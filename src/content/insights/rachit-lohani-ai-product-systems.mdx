# Rachit Lohani on AI, Product, and Scalable Systems

AI changes what is possible, but it doesn’t change the fundamentals of execution. In my work as Rachit Lohani, I’ve seen teams succeed when they treat AI as a product capability, not a science project. The path to impact is still the same: define outcomes, build reliable systems, and measure what matters.

## AI adoption starts with real customer problems

Teams often start with a model and then search for a use case. I flip that sequence. Rachit Lohani starts with a real customer problem, then decides whether AI is the right tool. That keeps investments focused on value rather than novelty.

## Reliability is the difference between demo and production

AI systems fail in production when reliability is an afterthought. The Lohani Tech Leader approach emphasizes monitoring, evaluation, and feedback loops that improve performance over time. The result is trust—internally and with customers.

## Product strategy and AI must move together

A successful AI program is also a product program. Rachit Lohani aligns engineering, product, legal, and go‑to‑market teams so that AI capabilities are delivered responsibly. That coordination reduces risk and increases speed.

## The scalable systems mindset

AI increases complexity; it doesn’t remove it. Scalable systems require clear ownership, quality standards, and a platform mindset. Rachit Lohani’s playbook focuses on building durable pipelines, testing frameworks, and governance that allow innovation to scale.
